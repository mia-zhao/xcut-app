This blog is written using Markdown, showcasing how to effectively use Markdown in your Next.js application. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text easily. In this post, we will cover how to set up Markdown in your Next.js project, including the necessary libraries, configuration, and an example image.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a simple way to format text using plain text syntax. It allows you to create headings, lists, links, images, and more without the need for complex HTML tags. This makes it an excellent choice for writing content, especially for blogs and documentation.

### Key Features of Markdown

- **Headings:** You can create headings of different levels using `#` for H1, `##` for H2, and so on.
- **Lists:** Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists:
  - Unordered list example:
    - Unordered list item 1
    - Unordered list item 2
  - Ordered list example:
    1. Ordered list item 1
    2. Ordered list item 2
- **Links:** You can create links easily: [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- **Images:** Adding images is straightforward: ![Example Image](/logo.svg "This is an example image from the public directory")

## Setting Up Markdown in Next.js

To set up Markdown in your Next.js project, you will need to configure your application to support MDX. MDX allows you to write JSX within your Markdown documents, enabling you to use React components alongside your Markdown content.

Refer to the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) for more detailed instructions on how to set up MDX in your Next.js project.
