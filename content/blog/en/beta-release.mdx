## Quick Install

### Step 1: Download and Install

### Step 2: Grant Accessibility Permission

On first launch, XCut will ask for Accessibility permission. This permission allows XCut to read menu structures from your apps to discover available shortcuts.

![Granting Accessibility Permission](/blog/xcut-allow-accessibility-permission.gif)

Click "Open Preferences" in the prompt to launch System Settings. Enable XCut in the Accessibility section. If the permission page doesn't appear automatically, navigate to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility and enable XCut manually.

**About this permission:** XCut only reads menu structures to discover shortcuts. It never modifies your apps, records your keystrokes, tracks your activity, or sends data anywhere. Everything stays on your Mac. See our [privacy policy](/privacy) for details.

### Step 3: Set Your XCut Shortcut (Optional)

The default shortcut to show or hide XCut overlay is `Control (^) + X`. To customize it, click the XCut menu bar icon (squirrel icon), select Settings, click the "Toggle XCut Overlay" field, and press your preferred key combination.

## Using XCut

Press your shortcut (`Control + X` by default) in any app to show or hide the XCut overlay. XCut displays available shortcuts for the active app. Type to search and filter shortcuts instantly. You can also pin shortcuts to top of the list for quick access.

### Deep Scan for More Shortcuts

Some apps use dynamic menus that can only be discovered when menus are opened. If the shortcuts list seems incomplete, you can click **Deep Scan** at the bottom of the XCut overlay.

**What Deep Scan does and doesn't do:**

- Briefly opens menus in your app to read available shortcuts
- Only runs when you click the "Deep Scan" button
- Automatically closes menus after reading
- **Does not** click, select, or execute any menu items
- **Does not** control or modify your app's behavior in any way

This process happens entirely on your Mac - nothing is tracked or sent anywhere.

### Mac Keyboard Symbols

New to Mac? Here's what those symbols in shortcuts mean:

- **⌘** Command (Cmd)
- **⌥** Option (Alt)
- **⌃** Control (Ctrl)
- **⇧** Shift
- **fn** Function or Globe
- **⎋** Escape
- **⌫** Delete
- **⏎** Return (Enter)
- **␣** Space
- **↹** Tab
- **↖** Home
- **↘** End

## Privacy First

XCut is designed with your privacy in mind:

**What XCut does:** Reads menu structures from your apps (via Accessibility permission) to discover shortcuts.

**What XCut doesn't do:** Modify your apps, record keystrokes, track activity, send data externally, or access your files.

Everything happens locally on your Mac. See our [privacy policy](/privacy) for complete details.

## Troubleshooting

**Shortcut doesn't bring up XCut?** Check if the XCut icon (squirrel) appears in your menu bar. If not, launch XCut from Applications or use Spotlight (⌘ + Space, type "XCut", press Enter).

**XCut doesn't show shortcuts?** Verify you [granted Accessibility permission](#step-2-grant-accessibility-permission) in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility.

**Shortcuts list seems incomplete?** Try [Deep Scan](#deep-scan-for-more-shortcuts) to discover shortcuts from dynamic menus.

**Shortcut not executing?** Ensure the target app is active (click on it first) before using the shortcut.

**Other issues or questions?** Email us at [beta@xcut.app](mailto:beta@xcut.app) or use our [feedback form](/feedback).
