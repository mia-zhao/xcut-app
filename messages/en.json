        "q": "What is XCut?",
        "a": "XCut is a keyboard shortcut assistant for macOS. It instantly shows you the available shortcuts for the app you're using, helping you work faster without memorizing every shortcut."
      },
      "why-accessibility": {
        "q": "Why does XCut need Accessibility permission?",
        "a": "XCut uses Apple's Accessibility API to read the menu structure of the app you're working in. This is how it detects available commands with shortcuts. XCut never records your keystrokes or sends personal data anywhere."
      },
      "which-apps": {
        "q": "Which apps does XCut work with?",
        "a": "XCut works with most macOS apps that use the standard menu structures. For apps with dynamic or complex menus, XCut's Deep Scan mode can detect commands more reliably. Some highly customized apps may have limited support."
      },
      "is-my-data-private": {
        "q": "Is my data private?",
        "a": "Yes. XCut runs locally on your Mac. Your clipboard history, shortcuts, and usage patterns are never tracked, logged, or sent anywhere. The only data that leaves your Mac is feedback you voluntarily submit through the feedback form."
      },
      "feedback": {
        "q": "How do I give feedback?",
        "a": "We'd love to hear your thoughts! You can send feedback directly <feedback>through our website</feedback> or via the feedback link inside the app."
      },
      "deep-scan": {
        "q": "What is Deep Scan?",
        "a": "Deep Scan is a feature that enables XCut to accurately detect commands within applications that utilize dynamic or complex menu structures. This feature is disabled by default. If you notice incomplete menus, you can activate Deep Scan to thoroughly load all available commands. It temporarily opens the menu bar to facilitate this scanning process."
